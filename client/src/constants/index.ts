				'- Discord: 44% cheaper than Slack\n' +
				'- Mattermost: 39% cheaper than Slack\n' +
				'\n' +
				'Recommendation:\n' +
				'Based on the information available as of May 14, 2025, switching from Slack could be beneficial, primarily due to cost savings. Microsoft Teams emerges as the strongest alternative for the following reasons:\n' +
				'\n' +
				'1. Cost efficiency: Offers significant savings (40%) compared to Slack.\n' +
				'2. Feature parity: Provides comparable features to Slack, with some advantages in video conferencing.\n' +
				'3. Strategic benefits: Deep integration with Microsoft 365 suite, which many businesses already use.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'For a team of 50 users, the annual savings of approximately $3,600 with Microsoft Teams is substantial. The feature set is robust, and the seamless integration with other Microsoft products could enhance overall productivity.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'However, the decision to switch should also consider:\n' +
				"1. The team's current reliance on Slack-specific features or integrations.\n" +
				'2. The potential disruption and learning curve associated with migrating to a new platform.\n' +
				"3. Long-term strategic alignment with Microsoft's ecosystem vs. maintaining flexibility with Slack's broader integration options.\n" +
				'\n' +
				"If the team heavily relies on Slack's unique features or extensive third-party integrations, the cost savings might not outweigh the benefits of staying with Slack. In this case, it may be worth negotiating with Slack for better pricing based on the competitive landscape.\n" +
				'\n' +
				'In conclusion, while Microsoft Teams offers the best balance of features and cost savings, the final decision should weigh the potential disruption against the long-term benefits of switching.'
